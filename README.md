joincpp is a C++ library that allows you to concatenate variables into a string with a delimiter.
A key feature of this library is its support for user-defined data types, making it suitable for use in any project.
In essence, it replicates the functionality of Python's `join` function.
You can literally do the following, for example:
```cpp
","sep.join(2.3, user_defined_class, "string", 3);
```
And it will work!
Data types can even vary within a single `join` call. A wide range of overloads is supported, allowing the use of arrays, vectors, and other types as arguments.

## Key Features
The library stands out favorably from its analogues due to the following features:
- Support for user-defined data types
- Simple and easy-to-understand interface
- A wide variety of overloads
- Doxygen documentation
- C++17 compatibility
- CMake support
- Header-only implementation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm3650/joincpp.git
```

2. Include the library in your project using CMake

```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE joincpp)
```

3. Declare the  header in your code

```cpp
#include "joincpp/join.h"
```

4. Additional resources
- You can explore [examples in corresponding folder](https://github.com/ibm3650/joincpp/tree/main/examples), 
- for a quick start. To build the examples, execute:
```bash
cmake joincpp -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
make
./example1 && ./example2
```

- To build and run the tests, execute:
```bash
cmake joincpp -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make
./test/joincpp_test
```

## Examples
<details>
<summary>Example of using with basic types</summary>

```cpp
    std::vector<int> v0 = {1, 2, 3};
    const std::string v0s = ","sep.join(v0);
    
    int v1[] = {1, 2, 3};
    const std::string v1s = ","sep.join(v1);
    
    const auto v2 = {1, 2, 3};
    const std::string v2s = ","sep.join(v2);
    
    const std::string v3s = ","sep.join(1, 2, 3, 4, v1, v0);
    
    const int* v4 = v1;
    const std::string v4s = ","sep.join(std::span{v4, std::size(v1)});
    
    const std::string v5s = ","sep.join(1);
    
    std::cout << "vector: " <<  v0s << std::endl;
    std::cout << "C array: " << v1s << std::endl;
    std::cout << "initializer_list: " << v2s << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Template pack: " << v3s << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Pointer: " << v4s << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Single value: " << v5s << std::endl;
```

<details>
<summary>Example with user-defined types</summary>

```cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <format>
#include "joincpp/join.h"

using namespace joincpp;

struct float_number {
uint8_t _sign;
size_t _exp;
size_t _mantissa;
};


template<>
struct stringify<float_number> {
std::string operator()(const float_number &value) const noexcept {
return std::format("float_number{{{}, {}, {}}}", value._sign, value._exp, value._mantissa);
}
};


int main() {
float_number arr[] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
const std::string output = "| |"sep.join(arr);
std::cout << "User defined formatting: " << output << std::endl;
return 0;
}

```
